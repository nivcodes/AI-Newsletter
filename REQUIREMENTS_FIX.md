# ✅ Requirements.txt Fix for GitHub Actions

## 🔧 What I Fixed

**Problem:** GitHub Actions was failing with:
```
ERROR: No matching distribution found for sqlite3
```

**Solution:** Removed the `sqlite3` line from requirements.txt because:
- sqlite3 is built into Python
- It's not available as a separate pip package
- No need to install it

## 📁 File Updated

**requirements.txt** - Removed problematic line:
```
# OLD (causing error):
sqlite3  # built-in

# NEW (fixed):
# sqlite3 is built into Python, no separate installation needed
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Commit this updated requirements.txt** to your GitHub repository
2. **Run the workflow again** - it should install all dependencies successfully now
3. **Your newsletter will generate and send properly**

## ✅ Expected Result

After uploading this fix:
- ✅ All pip dependencies install successfully
- ✅ No more "sqlite3" installation errors
- ✅ Newsletter scheduler runs completely
- ✅ Newsletter generates and sends via email

**Your GitHub Actions workflow is now ready to run flawlessly!** 🚀📧
