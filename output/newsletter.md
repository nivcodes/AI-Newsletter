 # The Rundown: NPR Sues Trump Over Executive Order Cutting Funding for Public Broadcasting

The Rundown: NPR challenges President Donald Trump's executive order aimed at slashing federal funding for NPR and PBS, claiming it is unconstitutional and a violation of the First Amendment.

- **First Amendment concerns:** The lawsuit alleges that Trump's characterization of public broadcasters as "biased media" and subsequent rescission of their funding infringes upon freedom of speech.
- **Separation of powers issue:** The suit argues that Trump is encroaching on Congress's power to determine how federal funds are spent, as the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB)‚Äînot the president‚Äîcontrols distribution of funds.
- **Independence of CPB:** CPB chief Patricia Harrison asserts that Trump does not have authority over CPB, as it is a private corporation authorized by congressional statute and independent from federal government control.

Why it matters: The lawsuit raises significant concerns about the separation of powers and freedom of speech in the context of government funding for media organizations. It also highlights ongoing efforts by the Trump administration to restrict public broadcasting's federal funding, potentially threatening the future of these important institutions.

 # The Rundown: PS5 Gets Affordable Ahead of Switch 2 Launch

The Rundown: Sony is offering a limited-time price drop on the PlayStation 5, making it cheaper than the anticipated Nintendo Switch 2 during its Summer Days of Play event.

- **PS5 Price Drop**: Starting May 28th and ending June 11th, the PlayStation 5 will be available for $399.99 USD / $509.99 CAD in a bundle with Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, saving up to $119.99 USD / $159.99 CAD compared to buying separately.
- **PS5 Pro Sale**: This is the first time Sony has discounted the PS5 Pro, which launched last year.
- **Better Deal Than Switch 2**: With just single-digit days left until the Switch 2 launches, the PS5's sale price of $399.99 offers a more affordable option compared to the $450 for a Switch 2 or the $500 for the Mario Kart World bundle.

## Why it matters

This price drop comes at a time when consumers are grappling with rising costs and tariff concerns, making the PS5's temporary affordability a welcome relief. Moreover, with Summer Game Fest on the horizon, Sony may soon announce a PlayStation State of Play event to showcase its upcoming titles, further boosting the appeal of the discounted console. üëâ [Read more](https://www.theverge.com/news/674677/ps5-sale-summer-2025-us-sony-play-days-summer-game-fest)
