 # **The Rundown:** LexisNexis Data Breach Exposes Personal Info of Over 364,000 People

**Summary:** A significant data breach at LexisNexis has potentially leaked sensitive information including Social Security numbers, contact details, and driver's license numbers for more than 364,000 individuals.

- **Breach Details**: The breach happened on December 25th, 2024, but was discovered by LexisNexis on April 1st, 2025. Notifications to the affected individuals are only now beginning.
- **Third-Party Involvement**: According to LexisNexis, an unauthorized third party accessed its data via a third-party software development platform.
- **Discovery and Response**: The company claims it launched an investigation and notified law enforcement upon discovering the breach. However, it's worth noting that the types of information exposed varied for each individual.

## **Why it matters**

This breach underscores the growing concern about data privacy and the handling of sensitive personal information by large corporations like LexisNexis. As a major data broker, LexisNexis collects and sells vast amounts of personal data for fraud and risk assessment purposes. Last year, it was involved in a controversy where driving data was shared with automakers and sold to insurance companies, resulting in higher premiums for drivers.

This incident also highlights the need for stricter regulations on data brokers to protect citizens' privacy rights, especially in light of the recent bill passed by the House aiming to block data brokers from selling Americans’ personal information to foreign adversaries. However, progress on this matter seems to have stalled since then.

 # The Rundown: Starlink Takes Center Stage in BEAD Program Review

The Rundown: A potential shift in the US Broadband Equity Access and Deployment (BEAD) program could favor Elon Musk's satellite internet provider, Starlink, over fiber-based connections.

* The plan's lead architect, Evan Feinman, claims three states were one step away from connecting their first residents under BEAD before delays by the Trump administration and recent appointee Howard Lutnick.
* Lutnick's proposed changes to BEAD could allocate funds to private interests like Starlink, potentially resulting in slower, less reliable, and more expensive internet for millions of households.

## Why it matters

If implemented, these changes could undermine the BEAD program's goal of providing high-quality, fiber-based internet to underconnected areas across the US. This shift towards satellite internet may not offer the same speed, reliability, and affordability as fiber connections, potentially leaving residents in rural areas with subpar internet options.

As a modern equivalent of nationwide telephone networks or electrification projects, BEAD has been three years in the making but hasn't connected anyone to the internet yet due to delays and criticisms from the political right. However, Feinman emphasizes that this was by design, as states were consistently urging for slower progress.

 # The Rundown: Interactive AI Worlds by Odyssey AI (Backed by Pixar's Cofounder)

The Rundown: Experience interactive video, imagined entirely by AI in real-time, as part of a research preview by Odyssey AI.

- Walk through blurry, real-time generated worlds using WASD keys (similar to first-person video games but with environments resembling the real world)
- Choose from various settings like wooded areas, shopping malls, and parking lots
- Collision detection is inconsistent; objects sometimes have collision while others allow you to pass through them

Why it matters:
While this early version of interactive video might not replace Fortnite or movies anytime soon, it offers a tantalizing glimpse into the future of AI-generated experiences. As AI tools continue to evolve, we can expect to see improvements in image quality and consistency, potentially leading to more immersive and engaging interactive video experiences.
