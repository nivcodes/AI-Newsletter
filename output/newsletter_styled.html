<p style="margin: 1em 0"># The Rundown: Starlink Takes Center Stage in BEAD Program Review</p>
<p style="margin: 1em 0">The Rundown: A potential shift in the US Broadband Equity Access and Deployment (BEAD) program could favor Elon Musk’s satellite internet provider, Starlink, over fiber-based connections.</p>
<ul style="padding-left: 20px; margin-top: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; line-height: 1.6">
<li>The plan’s lead architect, Evan Feinman, claims three states were one step away from connecting their first residents under BEAD before delays by the Trump administration and recent appointee Howard Lutnick.</li>
<li>Lutnick’s proposed changes to BEAD could allocate funds to private interests like Starlink, potentially resulting in slower, less reliable, and more expensive internet for millions of households.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="color: #1a73e8; font-size: 1.4em; margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 0.6em; font-weight: 600">Why it matters</h2>
<p style="margin: 1em 0">If implemented, these changes could undermine the BEAD program’s goal of providing high-quality, fiber-based internet to underconnected areas across the US. This shift towards satellite internet may not offer the same speed, reliability, and affordability as fiber connections, potentially leaving residents in rural areas with subpar internet options.</p>
<p style="margin: 1em 0">As a modern equivalent of nationwide telephone networks or electrification projects, BEAD has been three years in the making but hasn’t connected anyone to the internet yet due to delays and criticisms from the political right. However, Feinman emphasizes that this was by design, as states were consistently urging for slower progress.</p>
